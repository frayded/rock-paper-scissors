# rock-paper-scissors

This repository is to complete The Odin Project's [Rock Paper Scissors project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

## What is learned with this project?

Making a simple rock paper scissors game played in browser console with JavaScript, I have learned to:

- Organize variables to use.
- Packing variables in one function for more specific task.
- Using `for` loops for looping the game to make it more efficient!

## Bits about this project

TL;DR I didn't know the right keyword to search how to call a function inside a function.

Bits about this project. This is actually the project that held me back from progressing the most, like, half a year. Aside from dealing with personal matters, I was exasperated looking for "how to call a function inside a function" but I didn't know the keywords for that, only after I read back some of the materials that I finally got the right keywords to look up.

After that, it was all breezy easy...

Admittedly, I need to be more resilient when dealing with setbacks like this and be more open to TOP community.
