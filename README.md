# rock-paper-scissors

This repository is to complete The Odin Project's [Rock Paper Scissors project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

## What is learned with this project?

Making a simple rock paper scissors game played in browser console with JavaScript, I have learned to:

- Organize variables to use.
- Packing variables in one function for more specific task.
- Using `for` loops for looping the game of 5 rounds.
